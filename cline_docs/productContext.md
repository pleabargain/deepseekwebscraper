# Product Context

## Purpose
The DeepSeek Web Scraper exists to automate the extraction of blog post information from websites using AI-powered content analysis. It solves the challenge of reliably extracting structured data from semi-structured web content.

## Problems Solved

### Content Extraction
- Challenge: Extracting specific data points from varied blog layouts
- Solution: LLM-based extraction that understands context and content structure

### Data Structure
- Challenge: Converting unstructured web content to structured data
- Solution: Pydantic models ensure consistent data format and validation

### Automation
- Challenge: Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone
- Solution: Automated crawling and extraction pipeline

## Expected Operation

### Input
- Target website URL
- Content extraction schema
- LLM configuration parameters

### Processing
1. Crawler fetches webpage content
2. Content is chunked appropriately
3. LLM processes content against schema
4. Results are validated and structured

### Output
- JSON formatted data containing:
  * Blog post titles
